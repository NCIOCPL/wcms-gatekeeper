The XSL directory contains the pre-rending XSLT files used by GateKeeper. 

Currently the  CTGOVProtocol_HP.xsl, DrugInformationSummary.xsl, Protocol_HP.xsl, Protocol_Patient.xsl,
GeneticsProfessional.xsl, and Summary_HP.xsl are the only files used for pre-rendering.


The Protocol_Search_HP.xsl, Protocol_Search_Patient.xsl, Protocol_StudyContacts.xsl and 
Summary.xsl are remnants of CancerGov on-the-fly rendering which proved to be too slow and included here for completeness.


GeneticsProfessional.xsl is shared with CancerGov where it is still used for on-the-fly rendering.
