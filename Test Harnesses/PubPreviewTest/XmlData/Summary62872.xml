cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team
of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during
childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the primary care physician, pediatric surgical subspecialists, radiation
oncologists, pediatric medical oncologists/hematologists, rehabilitation
specialists, pediatric nurse specialists, social workers, and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
that will achieve optimal survival and quality of life.  (Refer to the PDQ <ExternalRef xref="http://cancer.gov/cancerinfo/pdq/supportivecare/">Supportive and Palliative Care</ExternalRef> summaries for specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer.)  </Para><Para id="_127">Guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of pediatric patients
with cancer have been outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics.<Reference refidx="2" />  At
these pediatric cancer centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate in these trials is offered to most patients/families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with therapy that is currently
accepted as standard.  Most of the progress made in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the <ExternalRef xref="http://cancer.gov/clinicaltrials">NCI 
Web site</ExternalRef>.</Para><Para id="_148">Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2002, childhood cancer mortality has decreased by more than 50%.<Reference refidx="1" />  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close follow-up because cancer therapy side effects may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000343584" url="/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/lateeffects/HealthProfessional">Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer</SummaryRef> for specific information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors.)</Para><Para id="_5">The tumors discussed in this summary are diverse; the discussion is arranged in
descending anatomic order, from infrequent tumors of the head and neck to rare
tumors of the urogenital tract and skin.  All of these cancers are rare enough
that most pediatric hospitals might see fewer than two in a year.  Most of
these tumors are more frequent in adults with cancer; thus, much of the
information about these tumors may also be sought through sources relevant to
adults with cancer.

Unusual pediatric head and neck cancers include nasopharyngeal carcinoma, esthesioneuroblastoma, thyroid tumors, 
 oral cancer, salivary gland cancer,  laryngeal carcinoma, papillomatosis, and respiratory tract carcinoma involving the <GeneName>NUT</GeneName> gene on chromosome 15.<Reference refidx="1" />  The prognosis,
diagnosis, classification, and treatment of these head and neck cancers are
discussed below.
 It must be emphasized that these cancers are seen very infrequently in patients younger than 15 years, and most of the evidence is derived from case series. </Para><SummarySection id="_107"><Title>Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</Title><Para id="_9">Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) arises in the lining of the nasal cavity and pharynx.<Reference refidx="2" /><Reference refidx="3" /> This tumor accounts for about one-third of all cancers of the upper airways. 
 NPC is very uncommon in children younger than 10 years, but increases in incidence to 0.8 and 1.3 per million per year in children aged 10 to 14 years and in children aged 15 to 19 years, respectively.<Reference refidx="4" /><Reference refidx="5" /> NPC is overrepresented in black children in the United States when compared with other malignancies.<Reference refidx="6" />  There is a higher frequency of this tumor
in North Africa and Southeast Asia.
</Para><Para id="_10">Nasopharyngeal carcinoma occurs in association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),
the virus associated with infectious mononucleosis.<Reference refidx="7" /> The virus can be detected
in biopsy specimens of these cancers, and tumor cells can have EBV antigens on
their cell surface.  Three histologic subtypes are recognized by the World
Health Organization (WHO).  Type 1 is squamous cell carcinoma, type 2 is
nonkeratinizing carcinoma, and type 3 is undifferentiated carcinoma. Children with NPC are more likely to have WHO type 2 or type 3 disease.<Reference refidx="5" />
</Para><Para id="_11">This cancer most frequently spreads to lymph nodes in the neck, which may alert
the patient, parent, or physician to the presence of this tumor.  The tumor may
also spread to the nose, mouth, and pharynx, causing snoring, epistaxis,
obstruction of the eustachian tubes, or hearing loss; it may also invade the
base of the skull, causing cranial nerve palsy or difficulty with movements of
the jaw (trismus).  Distant metastatic sites may include the bones, lungs,
and liver.  The location of the primary tumor can be determined by direct
inspection of the nasopharynx.  A diagnosis can be made from a biopsy of the
primary tumor or of enlarged lymph nodes of the neck.  Nasopharyngeal
carcinomas must be distinguished from all other cancers that can present with
enlarged lymph nodes and from other types of cancer in the head and neck area. 
Thus, diseases such as thyroid cancer, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-Hodgkin
lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and Burkitt lymphoma must be considered, as
should benign conditions such as nasal angiofibroma, which usually presents with
epistaxis in adolescent males, and infections draining into the lymph nodes of the neck.
</Para><Para id="_12">Diagnostic tests should determine the extent of the primary tumor and whether
there are metastases.  Visualization of the nasopharynx by an ear-nose-throat
specialist using a mirror, examination by a neurologist, and magnetic resonance
imaging of the head and neck can be used to determine the extent of the
primary tumor.  Evaluation of the chest and abdomen by computed tomography and bone scan should also be performed to determine whether there is metastatic
disease.  The levels of EBV and antibody to EBV should also be measured.<Reference refidx="2" /><Reference refidx="8" />
</Para><Para id="_13">Tumor staging is  performed utilizing the tumor-node-metastasis classification system
of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC).<Reference refidx="9" /> The majority (&gt;90%) of children and adolescents with NPC present with advanced disease (stage III/IV or T3/T4).<Reference refidx="10" /> Metastatic disease at diagnosis is uncommon (stage IVC). Outcome is directly related to the stage of the disease, with overall survival ranging from 80% for stage I and stage II to 40% for stage III.<Reference refidx="11" /> Other factors associated with an inferior outcome include node size larger than 6 cm, radiation dose less than 60 Gy, and poor response to chemotherapy.<Reference refidx="11" /> A retrospective analysis of data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program reported that patients younger than 20 years had a higher risk of developing a second malignancy, a higher incidence of advanced stage disease when compared with older patients, and a superior outcome after controlling for stage.<Reference refidx="5" /> The overall survival of children and adolescents with NPC has improved over the last four decades and about 80% are cured.<Reference refidx="5" /><Reference refidx="6" /> Although the outcome has improved with the use of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, significant morbidities do occur.<Reference refidx="6" /></Para><Para id="_555">Surgery has a limited role in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma because the disease is usually considered unresectable due to extensive local spread. </Para><Para id="_206">High-dose radiation therapy alone has had a role in the management of low-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma, but  studies in both children and adults  show that combined modality therapy with chemotherapy and radiation is the most effective way to treat nasopharyngeal carcinoma.<Reference refidx="6" /><Reference refidx="11" /><Reference refidx="12" /><Reference refidx="13" /><Reference refidx="14" /><Reference refidx="15" /> In a meta-analysis of studies adding chemotherapy to radiation therapy in adults with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, concomitant chemotherapy plus radiation therapy offered a significant benefit for survival, locoregional disease control, and reduction in distant metastases.<Reference refidx="14" /> Neoadjuvant chemotherapy resulted in a significant reduction in locoregional recurrence only, while postradiation chemotherapy did not offer any benefit. In children, two studies utilizing preradiation chemotherapy with methotrexate, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and leucovorin with or without recombinant interferon-beta reported response rates of more than 90%.<Reference refidx="16" /><Reference refidx="17" /> Initial chemotherapy with cisplatin and docetaxel prior to radiation in young patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma is associated with objective responses and favorable outcomes after radiation therapy.<Reference refidx="18" />[<LOERef href="CDR0000587991">Level of evidence: 3iiiDiv</LOERef>] Radiation therapy doses utilized in both studies were approximately 60 Gy. Investigators at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital performed a retrospective review of 59 young patients with NPC.<Reference refidx="6" /> They reported better outcome for patients whose treatment included cisplatin and for patients who received more than 50 Gy of radiation to the primary tumor and to the regional lymph nodes. These treatments were associated with a high probability of hearing loss, hypothyroidism, trismus, xerostomia, dental problems, and chronic sinusitis or otitis. Additional drug combinations that have been used in children with nasopharyngeal carcinoma  include bleomycin with epirubicin and cisplatin, cisplatin and fluorouracil, and cisplatin with methotrexate and bleomycin.<Reference refidx="3" /> Incorporation  of high-dose-rate brachytherapy into the chemoradiation therapy approach has been reported, but its role in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in children is unknown.<Reference refidx="19" /><Reference refidx="20" /></Para><Para id="_391">A preliminary report of the use of EBV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes revealed minimal toxicity and evidence of significant antitumor activity in patients with relapsed or refractory nasopharyngeal carcinoma.<Reference refidx="21" /> (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062918" url="/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/nasopharyngeal/HealthProfessional">Nasopharyngeal

larynx and is associated with the human papillomavirus (HPV), most commonly HPV-6 and HPV-11.<Reference refidx="121" />  The presence of HPV-11 appears to correlate with a more aggressive clinical course than HPV-6.<Reference refidx="122" /> These tumors can cause
hoarseness because of their association with wart-like nodules on the vocal
cords and may rarely extend into the lung, producing significant morbidity.<Reference refidx="123" /> Malignant

increased risk of brain tumors and hepatoblastoma.<Reference refidx="59" />  The familial APC
syndrome is caused by mutation of a gene on chromosome 5q, which normally
suppresses proliferation of cells lining the intestine and later development of
polyps.<Reference refidx="60" /> A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase I trial in children aged 10 to 14 years with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) reported that celecoxib at a dose of 16 mg/kg/day is safe for administration for up to 3 months.

younger patients with this histologic variant may be less responsive to
chemotherapy.  These tumors arise from the surface of the bowel, usually at the
site of an adenomatous polyp.  The tumor may extend into the muscle layer
surrounding the bowel, or the tumor may perforate the bowel entirely and seed
through the spaces around the bowel, including intra-abdominal fat, lymph
nodes, liver, ovaries, and the surface of other loops of bowel.  A high

lower colon.  Tumors of the right colon may cause more subtle symptoms but are
often associated with an abdominal mass, weight loss, decreased appetite, and
blood in the stool.  Any tumor that causes complete obstruction of the large
bowel can cause bowel perforation and spread of the tumor cells within the
abdominal cavity.
</Para><Para id="_70">Because of its rarity, colorectal carcinoma is rarely diagnosed in a pediatric
patient; however, vague gastrointestinal symptoms should alert the physician to
investigate this possibility.  Diagnostic studies that may be of value include

measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen, and various medical imaging studies,
including direct examination using colonoscopy to detect polyps in the large

</Para><Para id="_94">Biopsy or excision is necessary to determine the diagnosis of any skin cancer. 
Diagnosis is necessary for decisions regarding additional treatment.  Basal and
squamous cell carcinomas are generally curable with surgery alone, but the
treatment of melanoma requires greater consideration because of its potential
for metastasis.  The width of surgical margins in melanoma is dictated by the site, size, and thickness of the lesion and ranges from 0.5 cm for <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> lesions to 2 cm or more for thicker lesions.<Reference refidx="40" />  To achieve negative margins in children, wide excision with
skin grafting may become necessary in selected cases. Examination of regional lymph nodes using sentinel lymph node biopsy  has become routine in many centers<Reference refidx="73" /><Reference refidx="74" /> and is recommended in patients with lesions measuring  more than 1 mm in thickness or in those whose lesions are 1 mm or less in thickness and have unfavorable features such as ulceration, Clark level of invasion IV or V, or mitosis rate of 1 per mm<Superscript>2</Superscript>

Lymph node dissection is  recommended if sentinel nodes are involved with

of 1 year should be considered in these patients.<Reference refidx="40" /><Reference refidx="73" /><Reference refidx="77" /><Reference refidx="78" /><Reference refidx="79" /> Clinically benign melanocytic lesions can sometimes pose a significant diagnostic challenge, especially when they  involve regional lymph nodes.<Reference refidx="80" /><Reference refidx="81" /><Reference refidx="82" />  </Para><Para id="_491">The diagnosis of pediatric melanoma may be difficult and many of these lesions may be confused with the so-called melanocytic tumors of unknown metastatic potential (MELTUMP).<Reference refidx="83" /> These lesions are  biologically different from melanoma and benign nevi.<Reference refidx="83" /><Reference refidx="84" />  Novel diagnostic techniques are actively being used by various centers in an attempt to  differentiate melanoma from these challenging melanocytic lesions. For example, the absence of <GeneName>BRAF </GeneName> mutations or the presence of a normal chromosomal complement with or without 11p gains strongly argues against the diagnosis of melanoma.<Reference refidx="85" /><Reference refidx="86" /> In contrast, the use of FISH probes that target four specific regions in chromosomes 6 and 11 can help classify melanoma correctly in over 85% of the cases.<Reference refidx="87" /> <GeneName>HRAS</GeneName> mutations have been described in some cases of Spitz nevi but they have not been described in Spitzoid melanoma.

The incidence in the United States is approximately one case per one million people per year, and only 5% of all chordomas occur in patients younger than 20 years.<Reference refidx="93" /> In children and adolescents, chordomas are more likely to arise in the skull base rather than in the sacrum, making them relatively inaccessible to complete surgical excision.  Most pediatric patients have the conventional or chondroid variant of chordoma.<Reference refidx="93" /><Reference refidx="94" /> Patients usually present with pain, with or without neurologic deficits such as cranial or other nerve impairment.  Diagnosis is straightforward when the typical physaliferous (soap-bubble-bearing) cells are present.  Differential diagnosis is sometimes difficult and includes dedifferentiated chordoma and chondrosarcoma.  Standard treatment includes surgery, which is not commonly curative because of difficulty in obtaining clear margins, and external radiation therapy.  The best results have been obtained using proton-beam therapy (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000534234">charged-particle radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef>).<Reference refidx="95" /><Reference refidx="96" />; <Reference refidx="97" />[<LOERef href="CDR0000335158">Level of evidence: 3iiiDiii</LOERef>] Recurrences are usually local but can include distant metastases to lungs or bone.  Children younger than 5 years  appear to have a worse outlook than older patients.<Reference refidx="93" /><Reference refidx="98" /><Reference refidx="99" /> The survival rate in children and adolescents  ranges from about 50% to 80%.<Reference refidx="93" /><Reference refidx="99" /> There is no known effective cytotoxic agent or combination chemotherapy for this disease. Imatinib mesylate has been shown to have antitumor activity in adults with chordoma,<Reference refidx="100" />  and its effect might be the result of inhibition of phosphorylation and activation of <GeneName>PDGFR</GeneName> alpha, beta, and <GeneName>KIT</GeneName> receptors.<Reference refidx="101" /> This therapy has not been tested in children with chordoma.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_97"><Title>Cancer of Unknown Primary Site</Title><Para id="_98">Cancers of unknown primary site (CUPs) present as a metastatic cancer for which a precise primary tumor
site cannot be determined.<Reference refidx="102" />  As an example, lymph nodes at the base of the
skull may enlarge in relationship to a tumor that may be on the face or the
scalp but is not evident by physical examination or by radiographic imaging. 
Thus, modern imaging techniques may indicate the extent of the disease but not
a primary site.  Tumors such as adenocarcinomas, melanomas, and embryonal tumors
such as rhabdomyosarcomas and neuroblastomas may have such a presentation. Because of the age-related incidence of tumor types, embryonal histologies are more common in children. </Para><Para id="_99">For all patients who present with tumors from an unknown primary site,
treatment should be directed toward the specific histopathology of the tumor and
should be age appropriate for the general type of cancer initiated, irrespective of
the site or sites of involvement.<Reference refidx="102" /> Studies in adults suggest that positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can be helpful in identifying CUPs, particularly in patients whose tumors arise in the head and neck area.<Reference refidx="103" /> In addition, molecular assignment of tissue of origin using molecular profiling techniques is feasible and can aid in identifying the putative tissue of origin in about 60% of patients with CUPs.<Reference refidx="104" />  It is still unclear, however, whether these techniques can improve the outcomes or response rates of these patients, and no pediatric studies have been conducted.<Reference refidx="105" />
