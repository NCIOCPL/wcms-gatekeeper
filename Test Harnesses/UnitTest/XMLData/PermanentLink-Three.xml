                <Question>What is the history of the discovery and use of 714-X as a complementary and alternative treatment for cancer?</Question>
                <Answer>
                  <Para id="_9">714-X was developed in the 1960s in  Canada, where it is still being made. Patients in Canada can get 714-X only from a doctor, for compassionate use (giving a treatment to patients before it is approved, because they have a life-threatening disease and there is no <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000348921">drug</GlossaryTermRef> or other therapy to treat the disease).   714-X is used in Mexico and some western European countries. It is not approved by the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454785">US Food and Drug Administration</GlossaryTermRef> (FDA) for use in the United States (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000446580#_27" url="/cancertopics/pdq/cam/714-X/patient">Question 8</SummaryRef>). </Para>

              <QandAEntry id="_22">
                <Question>What is the theory behind the claim that 714-X is useful in treating cancer?</Question>
                <Answer>
                  <Para id="_10">The development of 714-X was based on the theory that there are tiny living things in the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000270735">blood</GlossaryTermRef> called somatids. According to this theory, some types of somatids are found only in the blood of people who have <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef> or other serious diseases. These types of somatids are said to make growth <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045713">hormones</GlossaryTermRef> that cause cells to grow without control. The makers of 714-X state that by looking at the number and type of somatids in the blood, doctors can see if cancer is starting to form or can <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046450">diagnose</GlossaryTermRef> cancer and predict where the cancer will spread. </Para>
                  <Para id="_28">The theory states that cancer cells trap nitrogen needed by normal cells and make a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043986">toxic</GlossaryTermRef> substance that weakens the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356">immune system</GlossaryTermRef>. 714-X is reported to help the body fight cancer cells in these ways: </Para>
                  <ItemizedList id="_29" Style="bullet">
                    <ListItem>The camphor in 714-X is said to prevent cancer cells from taking nitrogen from the body's normal cells. </ListItem>
                    <ListItem>714-X is also said to   help the immune system by increasing the flow of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046305">lymph</GlossaryTermRef>, the colorless <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044669">fluid</GlossaryTermRef> that travels through the body carrying <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045993">white blood cells</GlossaryTermRef> that help fight <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045364">infection</GlossaryTermRef> and disease. </ListItem>
                  </ItemizedList>
                  <Para id="_12">Some research studies are published in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044724">scientific</GlossaryTermRef> journals. Most scientific journals have experts who review research reports before they are published, to make sure that the evidence and conclusions are sound. This is called peer review. Studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals are considered to be better evidence. No studies have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals to support the theory of somatids in the development of cancer. Research  on the use of 714-X as a cancer treatment is discussed in <SummaryRef href="CDR0000446580#_24" url="/cancertopics/pdq/cam/714-X/patient">Question 5</SummaryRef> and <SummaryRef href="CDR0000446580#_25" url="/cancertopics/pdq/cam/714-X/patient">Question 6</SummaryRef>.</Para>

                  <Para id="_13">714-X is usually given by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044678">injection</GlossaryTermRef> near the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045762">lymph nodes</GlossaryTermRef> in the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046375">groin</GlossaryTermRef>.  In some patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000445043">lung</GlossaryTermRef> or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000445073">oral cancer</GlossaryTermRef>, 714-X can be sprayed into the nose using a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044063">nebulizer</GlossaryTermRef> (a device that turns liquid into a fine spray).

            <Para id="_AboutPDQ_3">Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also referred to as integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. </Para>
            <Para id="_AboutPDQ_4">Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. </Para>
            <Para id="_AboutPDQ_5">Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any therapeutic approach, because some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. </Para>

          <SummarySection id="_AboutPDQ_6">
            <Title>Evaluation of CAM Approaches</Title>
            <Para id="_AboutPDQ_7">It is important that the same rigorous scientific evaluation used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer. </Para>
            <Para id="_AboutPDQ_8">Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Conference in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.</Para>

              <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/cam/bestcase_intro.html">The NCI Best Case Series Program</ExternalRef>, which was started  in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and develops follow-up research strategies for approaches deemed to warrant NCI-initiated research.</Para>
