		  lobes, which have many smaller sections called <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046308">lobules</GlossaryTermRef>. Lobules end in dozens of tiny bulbs that
		  can produce milk. The lobes, lobules, and bulbs are linked by thin tubes called
		  ducts. <MediaLink ref="CDR0000415520" type="image/jpeg" alt="Drawing of female breast anatomy showing  the lymph nodes, nipple, areola, chest wall, ribs, muscle, fatty tissue, lobe, and ducts." language="en" thumb="Yes" id="_281"><Caption language="en">Anatomy of the female breast.

Most of the information contained in PDQ is available online at <ExternalRef xref="http://cancer.gov">NCI's Web site</ExternalRef>.  PDQ is provided as a service of the NCI.

Most summaries are available in two versions.  The health professional versions provide detailed information written in technical language.  The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language.  Both versions provide current and accurate cancer information. </Para><Para id="_AboutPDQ_5"><Emphasis><Strong>The PDQ cancer information summaries are developed by cancer experts and reviewed regularly.</Strong></Emphasis></Para><Para id="_AboutPDQ_6">Editorial Boards made up of experts in oncology and related specialties are responsible for writing and maintaining the cancer information summaries.  The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made as new information becomes available.  The date on each summary ("Date Last Modified") indicates the time of the most recent change.</Para><Para id="_AboutPDQ_7"><Emphasis><Strong>PDQ also contains information on clinical trials.</Strong></Emphasis></Para><Para id="_AboutPDQ_8">A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another.  Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory.  Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients.  During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works.  If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.</Para><Para id="_AboutPDQ_9">Listings of clinical trials are included in PDQ and are available online at <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials">NCI's Web site</ExternalRef>.  Descriptions of the trials are available in health professional and patient versions.  Many cancer doctors who take part in clinical trials are also listed in PDQ.
