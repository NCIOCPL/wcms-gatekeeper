is arranged in descending order from tumors of the head and neck to tumors of
the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044093">urinary</GlossaryTermRef> system and skin.  All of these <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancers</GlossaryTermRef> are rare enough that most
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046245">pediatric</GlossaryTermRef> hospitals might see fewer than two cases in a year.  Most of these
tumors are more frequent in adults with cancer; thus, much of the information
about these tumors may also be sought through sources relevant to adults with
these tumors.

<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046025">nasopharyngeal</GlossaryTermRef> cancers.  The <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046145">incidence</GlossaryTermRef> of this <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumor</GlossaryTermRef> is approximately 1 in
100,000 persons younger than 20 years in the United States.

nodes in the neck at the time of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046450">diagnosis;</GlossaryTermRef> thus, the principal role of surgery
is to obtain adequate diagnostic material from a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045164">biopsy</GlossaryTermRef> of the involved lymph
node or the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045847">primary site</GlossaryTermRef>. Studies show that combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy is the most effective treatment for this tumor.

Most children have a tumor in the nose or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000439429">throat</GlossaryTermRef> at the time of diagnosis.  The tumor may extend into the eyes, sinuses, and the front part of the brain.  Esthesioneuroblastoma occurs more often in boys and usually appears during adolescence.

Treatment for this <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef> is usually <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045570">surgery</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044971">radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef>; <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045214">chemotherapy</GlossaryTermRef> may also be used.

</Para>
			<Para id="_12">  Thyroid carcinomas are rare and occur most often in girls. This cancer usually appears as a lump or mass in the thyroid with possible swelling of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044489">lymph glands</GlossaryTermRef> in the neck. </Para>

				<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045570">Surgery</GlossaryTermRef> is the treatment required for all thyroid <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumors</GlossaryTermRef>.  This is usually removal of all or nearly all of the thyroid and nearby lymph nodes in the neck. Treatment with a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046550">radioactive</GlossaryTermRef> form of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044548">iodine</GlossaryTermRef> is given after surgery to destroy cancer cells and thyroid <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683">tissue</GlossaryTermRef> that remain. After
surgery and treatment with radioactive iodine, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046127">hormone replacement therapy</GlossaryTermRef> must be given to compensate for the lost
thyroid <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045713">hormone</GlossaryTermRef>.   Regular checkups are required
to determine whether the cancer has spread to the lungs.  Patients with thyroid
cancer generally have an excellent survival with relatively few <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046580">side effects</GlossaryTermRef>. 
Thyroid tumors that <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046556">recur</GlossaryTermRef> (come back) are usually treated with radioactive iodine. Even patients with tumor that has spread to the lungs may expect no decrease in
life span after appropriate treatment. (Refer to the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044271">PDQ</GlossaryTermRef> summary on adult

		<Para id="_AboutPDQ_14">PDQ is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database.  Most of the information contained in PDQ is available online at  <ExternalRef xref="http://cancer.gov">NCI's Web site</ExternalRef>.  PDQ is provided as a service of the NCI.  The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health, the federal government's focal point for biomedical research. </Para>

				<Strong>PDQ contains cancer information summaries. </Strong>
			</Emphasis>
		</Para>
		<Para id="_AboutPDQ_4">The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine.  Most summaries are available in two versions.  The health professional versions provide detailed information written in technical language.  The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language.  Both versions provide current and accurate cancer information. </Para>
		<Para id="_AboutPDQ_5">

				<Strong>The PDQ cancer information summaries are developed by cancer experts and reviewed regularly.</Strong>
			</Emphasis>
		</Para>
		<Para id="_AboutPDQ_6">Editorial Boards made up of experts in oncology and related specialties are responsible for writing and maintaining the cancer information summaries.  The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made as new information becomes available.  The date on each summary ("Date Last Modified") indicates the time of the most recent change.</Para>
		<Para id="_AboutPDQ_7">

				<Strong>PDQ also contains information on clinical trials.</Strong>
			</Emphasis>
		</Para>
		<Para id="_AboutPDQ_8">In the United States, about two-thirds of children with cancer are treated in a clinical trial at some point in their illness.  A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another.  Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory.  Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients.  During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about new treatments, the risks involved, and how well they do or do not work.  If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard."</Para>
		<Para id="_AboutPDQ_9">Listings of clinical trials are included in PDQ and are available online at <ExternalRef xref="http://cancer.gov/clinical_trials">NCI's Web site</ExternalRef>.  Descriptions of the trials are available in health professional and patient versions.  For additional help in locating a childhood cancer clinical trial, call the Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237), TTY at 1-800-332-8615.</Para>

		<Para id="_AboutPDQ_12">Because cancer in children and adolescents is rare, the majority of children with cancer are treated by health professionals specializing in childhood cancers, at hospitals or cancer centers with special facilities to treat them.  The PDQ database contains listings of health professionals who specialize in childhood cancer and listings of hospitals with cancer programs.  For help locating childhood cancer health professionals or a hospital with cancer programs, call the Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237), TTY at 1-800-332-8615.</Para>
