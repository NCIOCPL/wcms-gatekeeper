          <Para id="_475">
            There are many types of brain and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000340937">spinal cord</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumors</GlossaryTermRef>. The tumors are formed by the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044636">abnormal</GlossaryTermRef> growth of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046476">cells</GlossaryTermRef> and may begin in different parts of the brain or spinal cord. Together, the brain and spinal cord make up the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046481">central nervous system</GlossaryTermRef> (CNS).

            The tumors may be <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045614">benign</GlossaryTermRef> (not <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef>) or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045772">malignant</GlossaryTermRef> (cancer). Benign <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000387264">brain tumors</GlossaryTermRef> grow and press on nearby areas of the brain. They rarely spread into other <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683">tissues</GlossaryTermRef> and may <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046556">recur</GlossaryTermRef> (come back). Malignant brain tumors are likely
            to grow quickly and spread into other brain tissue. When a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain, it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should. Both benign and malignant brain tumors can cause <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045022">symptoms</GlossaryTermRef> and need treatment.

            Often, tumors found in the brain have started somewhere else in the body and spread to one or more parts of the brain. These are called <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044058">metastatic</GlossaryTermRef> brain tumors (or brain metastases). Metastatic

          PDQ is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database.  Most of the information contained in PDQ is available online at <ExternalRef xref="http://cancer.gov">NCI's Web site</ExternalRef>.  PDQ is provided as a service of the NCI.  The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health, the federal government's focal point for biomedical research.

        </Para>
        <Para id="_AboutPDQ_4">The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine.  Most summaries are available in two versions.  The health professional versions provide detailed information written in technical language.  The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language.  Both versions provide current and accurate cancer information. </Para>

The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made as new information becomes available.  The date on each summary ("Date Last Modified") indicates the time of the most recent change.</Para>

          </Emphasis>
        </Para>
        <Para id="_AboutPDQ_8">A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another.  Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory.  Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients.  During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works.  If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.</Para>
        <Para id="_AboutPDQ_9">
          Listings of clinical trials are included in PDQ and are available online at <ExternalRef xref="http://cancer.gov/clinical_trials">NCI's Web site</ExternalRef>.  Descriptions of the trials are available in health professional and patient versions.  Many cancer doctors who take part in clinical trials are also listed in PDQ.
